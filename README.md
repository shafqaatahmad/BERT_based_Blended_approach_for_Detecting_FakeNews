# BERT_based_Blended_approach_for_Detecting_FakeNews
BERT-LSTM and BERT-CNN based approach for detecting fake news on social media

A a new approach for detecting fake news on social media. Previous works in this domain have demonstrated that context is an important factor when attempting to distinguish subtle differences within text. Fake news itself presents different level of difficulty due the vast similarity that exists between genuine and fake news contents. Therefore, we propose a collaborative approach which uses probabilistic fusion strategy to combine the knowledge gained from modelling two language models, BERT-LSTM and BERT-CNN. To achieve the fusion we exploit bayesian method. Our experiments are conducted on two fake news detection datasets. The detection accuracy attained in these experiments attest to the efficiency of
the proposed method, as our approach is very competitive with state-of-the-art methods. Index Terms—Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Deep Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, BERT
